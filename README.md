# BookStore-MERN-Stack. This is a repository for my Book Store MERN Stack Project.
At present, this is a simple and basic Book App where we can 
    * store a collection of books,
    * add new books,
    * edit and
    * update them.
* And if we don't want any book in our collection, we can delete that.
So we can perform CRUD operation on books-collection.
Moreover, the app has a select menu to choose book categories to read and download.
The app has three main pages i.e., Home, Books, and About,
and three sub-pages i.e., createBook, editBook, and UpdateBook.
